# Battleship
<em> Simple text-based battleship game in Python, personal projectÂ </em>

<h3> Description </h3>
This game has 2 modes: a solo mode where the user simply guesses the computer's ship positions, and a normal mode where the user and computer take turns guessing each other's ship locations. Within each mode, there is the option of playing until all ships have been guessed or to set a maximum number of guesses and play until the guesses run out or all the ships have been found, whichever coomes first.

<strong> Disclaimer </strong>: the normal mode is currently under production and has not been finalized yet. The user is able to place their ships on the board, but the guessing has not been set up yet so the game ends once the player's ships have been placed. Solo mode is playable.
